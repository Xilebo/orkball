Orkball
=======

A MMO Browser Game about Orks playing ball and slaughtering each other.

Influences
======
As every great idea Orkball is influenced by other great ideas. The most important influences are:
 - Grunts! by Mary Gentle - a great book were a very similar game is played by orks. It may even have the same name if I think about it.
 - Jugger - A sport inspired by a bad movie called "The Salute of the Jugger" or "The Blood of Heroes". It's like Orkball, unly with human players and a dogskull instead of an orkhead.

The Game
======
Orks like bloody games and feasts. So what they do is grab the head of the weakest ork around, remove the distracting body, kill each other at trying to get the "ball" to the enemy goal and afterwards roast the dead and have a great party.
The player manages a team of orks who do nothing else than playing orkball. He has gets lots of volunteer, wanting to play and has to feed those, who survive the match.
